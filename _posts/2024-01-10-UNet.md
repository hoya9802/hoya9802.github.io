## Abstract.
The U-Net, proposed in 2015, represents a CNN framework primarity employed for image segmentation tasks. this model was designed for medical image segmentation.

It comprises <span style='color:red'>**two main features**</span>:
 - <span style='color:red'>Contracting path:</span> Responsible for feature extraction of context(Overall image with information such as texture, color, shape, etc. around a pixel or object)
 - <span style='color:red'>Symmetric expanding path:</span> Facilitating precise localization

Due to these features, U-Net demonstrates remarkable performance in segmentation tasks and outperforms the prior best method(<span style='color:yellow'>a sliding-window convolutional network</span>)

<span style='color:yellow'>In order to find multi objects in a large image, divide the entire image into areas of the right and apply the localization network made in the previous step repeating for each area.</span>

U-Net is so fast because inference time of segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. Just looking at it, the existing method sliding-window convolutional network seems to take a long time to infer.

## 1, Introduction
![u-net-architecture](/images/2024-01-10-UNet/UNet-arc.png){: .align-center}<br>
This model was built upon by [FCN](https://hoya9802.github.io/paper-review/FCN/)<span style='color:yellow'>(you can check the organized FCN in that link)</span>. In this paper, they tried to modify and extent this model such that it works with very few training datasets and yields more precise result (see Figure <span style='color:red'>1</span>).

One significant modification in this architecture is the inclusion of a large number of feature channels in the upsampling part. This enhancement enables the network to convey context information to higher-resolution layers. <span style='color:red'>Consequently, the expansive path(=Decoding path) is approximately symmetric to the contracting path(=Encoding path), resulting in a ***U-shaped architecture***.</span>
